# Scraggily Pets

When looking to adopt a pet, it’s important to know that some animals are more overlooked than others.

For Bootcamp Project 1, my group created a web app that uses Petfinder API to search for senior and special needs dogs and cats in the Seattle, WA area.

## Usage

* 3 randomized Featured Pets cards will appear at page load.
    -User is able to follow link that opens in new tab to find pet's full Petfinder profile
    -Created by me
* The hamburger menu jumps to corresponding page section
    -All CSS created by teammate
* The "Feeline Lucky" button randomizes a WA state National Forest hiking trail
    -Linked by teammate. Opens in new tab
* The Senior Dog/Cat and Special Needs Dog/Cat Search buttons return a randomized list of 20 adoptable pets in the area, including their name, bio, and profile photo
    -Opens in new tab
    -Created by me
* The Contact Us button that links to Petfinder’s info page on new tab
    -Created by teammate

### Technologies Used

Along with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript for site design, we also utilized:

* Petfinder API:
    <https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/>
* National Parks Service API:
    <https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm>
* Tailwind CSS Framework:
    <https://tailwindcss.com/>

### Future Dev

Would like to:

* Expand into other cities and states with a user input search button function
* Offer the ability to narrow search to a specific age, physical trait, or medical condition
    For example:
  * A potential adopter who’s home is already equipped for a pet that uses a wheelchair
  * A potential adopter that has experience caring for blind pets, or is comfortable giving daily shots/pills
* A search button to feature pets that have been at shelters the longest
* Would like the featured pet section to be a carousel to showcase more animals
* Change CSS and Mobile view/responsive experience
